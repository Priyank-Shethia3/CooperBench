**Title**: Add GUID Type for Windows-Style GUID Validation

**Pull Request Details**
Introduces a new `guid` type that validates Windows-style GUIDs with braces using regex pattern matching, complementing the existing validation types for Microsoft-specific environments.

**Description**:
This feature adds a `guid` type that matches Windows-style GUID format with curly braces, such as `{12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012}`. The type uses a regex pattern to validate the standard Microsoft GUID format, providing developers working in Windows environments with a convenient validation option that matches the platform's native GUID representation. This complements the existing validation types by offering format-specific validation for scenarios where the braced format is required.

**Technical Background**:
**Problem**: Windows systems and Microsoft technologies commonly represent GUIDs with surrounding curly braces (e.g., `{12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012}`), which differs from standard UUID formats without braces. Currently, developers need to create custom regex patterns or manually handle the brace formatting when working with Windows GUIDs in structured generation scenarios. This creates inconsistency and additional boilerplate code in applications that need to validate Microsoft-style GUID formats.

**Proposed Enhancement**: Provide a built-in `guid` type that validates the exact Windows GUID format with proper hexadecimal character validation and correct segment lengths, making it easily accessible alongside existing validation types like `email`, `isbn`, and other predefined patterns.

**Pattern Requirements**:
   - Must accept both uppercase and lowercase hexadecimal characters (a-f, A-F, 0-9)
   - Must enforce exact segment lengths: 8-4-4-4-12 hexadecimal characters
   - Must require curly braces as delimiters
   - Must require hyphens as segment separators
   - Must reject any deviation from the exact format

**Integration**:
   - The `guid` type will be automatically exported through the module's `__init__.py` file
   - It will be available as `outlines.types.guid` or `from outlines.types import guid`
   - It inherits all functionality from the `Regex` class, including validation methods and Pydantic integration

**Benefits**:
- Provides native support for Windows-style GUID validation without custom regex patterns
- Maintains consistency with existing type validation patterns in the codebase
- Integrates seamlessly with Pydantic models and JSON schema generation
- Reduces boilerplate code for Microsoft-specific applications
- Follows the established pattern of other predefined types like `email` and `isbn`

**Files Modified**:
- `outlines/types/__init__.py` (adding the new `guid` type definition)
