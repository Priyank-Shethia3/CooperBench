**Title**: Faster Parquet Streaming + Filters with Predicate Pushdown

**Pull Request Details**:

**Description**:
This update improves the performance of Parquet data streaming by utilizing a buffered stream, which speeds up streaming operations (approximately doubling speed on certain machines). Additionally, a new `filters` configuration parameter has been introduced, enabling predicate pushdown when reading Parquet files. This feature allows users to filter data on the fly, reducing the amount of data read into memory and improving query efficiency.

For example, you can filter a dataset by specific column values as shown below:

```python
from datasets import load_dataset

filters = [('problem_source', '==', 'math')]
ds = load_dataset("nvidia/OpenMathInstruct-2", streaming=True, filters=filters)
first_example = next(iter(ds["train"]))
print(first_example["problem_source"])
# 'math'
```

**Technical Background**:
**Problem**:
Streaming data from Parquet files can be slow, especially for large datasets. Additionally, applying filters while loading data was not natively supported, which resulted in unnecessary data being loaded into memory.

**Solution**:
* Implement faster Parquet streaming using a buffered stream to enhance data reading performance.
* Introduce the `filters` configuration parameter to support predicate pushdown, which applies filters directly during data reading, reducing memory usage and speeding up data loading.
