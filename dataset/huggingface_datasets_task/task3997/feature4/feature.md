**Title**: Extended `update` Method

**Pull Request Details**

**Description**:
This PR extends the `update` method of the `Features` class to support additional types, such as JSON, and allows for batch updates. The enhanced method improves flexibility when working with diverse data types, though it may conflict with the existing decorator-enhanced update method.

**Technical Background**:
**Problem**:
The current `update` method in `Features` only supports a limited set of types and lacks the ability to handle batch updates, limiting its usability for diverse data types and more complex workflows.

**Solution**:
The method is modified to support additional types (like JSON) and handle batch updates. Careful attention was given to ensure compatibility with the existing decorator-enhanced method, though there is potential for conflict.
