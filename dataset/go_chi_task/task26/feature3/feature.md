# Title: feat(mux): add request-based route selection with dynamic routing

**Description:**

This PR adds dynamic routing capabilities to chi, allowing applications to
select different routing handlers based on request properties beyond just
the URL path.

This allows for:

- Version-based routing (e.g., via Accept header)
- User role-based routing (selecting different handlers based on auth context)
- Feature flag-based routing (enabling/disabling endpoints dynamically)

The implementation adds a new request context evaluation step during route matching
that allows applications to customize route selection based on any criteria.

## Technical Background

### Issue Context:

Modern APIs often need to route requests dynamically based on factors like API versioning, feature flags, or user permissions. Traditional static routing based solely on URL patterns is insufficient for these use cases.

This feature enables request-based dynamic routing by adding a context evaluation phase to the routing process. This allows applications to examine the request context (headers, auth info, etc.) and select the appropriate handler accordingly.
