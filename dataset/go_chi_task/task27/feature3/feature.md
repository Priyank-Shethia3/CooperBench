# feat: add detailed logging for route pattern handling

**Description:**

Adds detailed debug-level logging for route pattern handling to make debugging easier and to provide more transparency into how patterns are parsed and processed.

- Adds logging infrastructure for pattern handling in `Handle` and `HandleFunc`
- Logs pattern parsing information including method detection
- Integrates with existing logging mechanism

## Issue Context:

Developers have reported difficulty debugging route handling issues, particularly with complex patterns or when methods are involved. This change provides more visibility into the pattern handling process.
