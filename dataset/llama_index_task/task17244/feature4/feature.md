**Title**: Add `force_mimetype` Parameter to `resolve_image` for Explicit MIME Type Overrides

**Pull Request Details**:
This PR introduces a new `force_mimetype` parameter to the `resolve_image` method, enabling explicit MIME type specification when resolving image data. It enhances flexibility by allowing callers to override or supply a MIME type directly.

**Description**:
The `resolve_image` method currently infers the MIME type of image data based on file extensions or content headers. However, this inference can fail or be ambiguous in cases where image sources lack sufficient metadata, such as raw buffers or pre-encoded base64 strings. By adding a `force_mimetype` argument, users gain explicit control over the MIME type, ensuring consistent behavior in image rendering, transmission, or serialization workflows. This is particularly beneficial in pipelines where MIME type accuracy is critical, such as LLM input formatting or API integrations.

**Technical Background**:
**Problem**:
Currently, `resolve_image` relies on heuristics to determine the MIME type, which may not suffice for non-standard or dynamically generated image data. This enhancement provides a deterministic override mechanism for such cases.

Callers using `resolve_image` on raw byte streams, buffers, or already base64-encoded data lack a reliable method to specify the MIME type explicitly. MIME inference can be unreliable or incorrect, leading to downstream issues in scenarios requiring strict MIME conformance, such as HTML rendering, API responses, or LLM content blocks.

**Solution**:
This PR extends the `resolve_image` method signature by introducing an optional `force_mimetype: str | None = None` parameter. If provided, this MIME type is used in place of inferred types during resolution and base64 encoding workflows. The logic ensures that `force_mimetype` takes precedence, providing a deterministic outcome for MIME-sensitive use cases.
