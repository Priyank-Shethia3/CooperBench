**Title**: Add Progress Callback Hook to Audio Resolution for Byte Tracking

**Pull Request Details**
Introduces an optional `on_resolve` callback parameter to the `resolve_audio()` method, enabling consumers to track the final byte size of resolved audio buffers. This enhancement supports UI progress indicators, logging, and custom metric collection.

**Description**
This feature allows developers to pass a progress hook via the `on_resolve` parameter when calling `AudioBlock.resolve_audio()`. The callback receives the byte count of the resolved audio buffer, providing visibility into data size at runtime. This is especially beneficial in UI contexts (e.g., displaying load progress) or for backend monitoring and analytics systems that depend on precise resource usage metrics.

**Technical Background**

**Problem**
Consumers of audio blocks may need insight into how much data is processed during resolution, especially when displaying user-facing progress updates or gathering telemetry. Previously, there was no way to extract this size information without duplicating resolution logic or manually inspecting buffers.

**Solution**
An optional `on_resolve: Callable[[int], None]` argument is added to the `resolve_audio()` method. After resolving and trimming the audio buffer, the callback is invoked with the final byte length of the buffer. This change is fully backward compatible and only activates if the hook is explicitly provided.
