**Title**: Add `resolve_*_with_size()` variants to return buffer and byte count

**Pull Request Details**:

**Description**:
Introduces new methods `resolve_image_with_size()`, `resolve_audio_with_size()`, and `resolve_document_with_size()` that return a tuple `(BytesIO, int)`. This provides both the resolved buffer and its byte size in a single call.

**Technical Background**:
**Problem**:
Consumers of the `resolve_*` methods often need to determine the size of the resolved content. Currently, this requires manually seeking the buffer, which is repetitive and error-prone.

**Solution**:
Implement new method variants that encapsulate both resolution and size calculation. The original `resolve_*` methods remain unchanged for backward compatibility.
