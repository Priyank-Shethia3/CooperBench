**Title**: Fix Incorrect Ideal DCG Calculation in NDCG Metric

**Pull Request Details**

**Description**:
This PR corrects the computation of the Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG) metric by properly calculating the ideal DCG (IDCG) based on the expected relevant document IDs instead of the retrieved document IDs. 

**Technical Background**:
**Problem**:
The prior implementation of the NDCG metric incorrectly computed the ideal DCG using the length of the retrieved documents rather than the expected relevant documents. This led to inaccurate normalization and scoring behavior, particularly in cases where the number of relevant documents differed from the number of retrieved documents. A previous fix attempt did not address this underlying issue.

**Solution**:
The fix redefines the IDCG calculation to iterate over the number of expected relevant documents, aligning with standard definitions of NDCG.
